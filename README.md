## ⭐ Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent job postings using structured dataset features such as:

- Employment type  
- Required experience  
- Location  
- Salary range  
- Company profile metadata  
- Benefits, telecommute flag, company logo flag, etc.  
 
 It relies purely on **categorical/ numerical features**, feature engineering, and ML classification algorithms.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Online job portals often host fake job listings created by scammers.  
These fraudulent posts:

- Target fresh graduates and job seekers  
- Collect personal data  
- Offer unrealistic salaries or suspicious requirements  

Manual checking is time-consuming and unreliable.  
This system automates the detection process using ML.
